# Specification Quality Checklist: Day12 Performance Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Feature**: [specs/001-day12-optimization/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (resolved - performance target set to under 1 second)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Issues Found

**RESOLVED**: All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been addressed with user input. Performance target set to "under 1 second per 12x5 region" per user selection.

## Notes

- ✅ Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All validation criteria met
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan`
